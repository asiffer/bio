I am a Ph.D. student under the supervision of Pierre-Alain Fouque and Alexandre Termier. I am a member of both <a href="https://www.irisa.fr/emsec/">EMSEC</a> Team and <a href="https://team.inria.fr/lacodam/">LACODAM</a> Team at IRISA/Inria Lab in Rennes (Brittany, France).

My Ph.D. is funded by <a href="https://www.amossys.fr/">Amossys</a> which is a pure player cyber-security company in Rennes.

My thesis deals with **cyber-attacks detection with statistical learning methods**. The idea is to bridge from AI (I apologize for this run-of-the-mill word) to cyber-security.
