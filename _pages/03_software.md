<h2>libspot</h2>

In our work, we developped an algorithm aimed to detect outliers in streaming data: SPOT.
**libspot** is a C++ library which mainly implements it. 

Recently we released **python3-libspot** which embeds `python3` bindings to libspot.


This code is hosted on <a href="https://asiffer.github.io/libspot/">github</a> and <a href="https://launchpad.net/~asiffer/+archive/ubuntu/libspot">launchpad</a>
(so you can just add my ppa to your ubuntu system, use `apt-get` magic command and you are done!)

<h2>Rfolding</h2>
I am currently working on a `R` library which implements a new statistical test of unimodality.
