## Teaching

**2017-2018** -- Informatique, Master 1 pr√©paration CAPES

**2016-2017** -- Projet VET, Master2 SSI, Rennes.  
I supervised four students on cyber-security on a machine learning project. They implement and analyze the DBSCAN algorithm. Moreover they test it on several datasets et compare it with other common methods. 



## Other

As a great deal of people involved in cyber-security, I try to improve my -- poor -- hacking skills.
